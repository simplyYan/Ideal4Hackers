   ```

Basic Usage
===========

PiPAl has a straightforward command-line syntax. Here is the basic command to use PiPAl:

```plaintext
pipal <options> <password_file>
```

- `<options>`: Specify any desired options or flags.
- `<password_file>`: Provide the path to the file containing the set of passwords you want to analyze.

Examples
========

Example 1: Analyzing a Password Set
-------------------------------------

To analyze a set of passwords saved in a file called `passwords.txt`, use the following command:

```bash
pipal passwords.txt
```

PiPAl will generate various statistics and visualizations based on the provided password set.

Example 2: Using Custom Password Policy Rules
---------------------------------------------

You can define custom password policy rules and analyze password sets against these rules. For example, to check if passwords in `passwords.txt` meet a minimum length of 8 characters and contain at least one uppercase letter and one digit:

```bash
pipal passwords.txt --minlen=8 --minupper=1 --mindigit=1
```

PiPAl will evaluate the password set against the custom rules and provide analysis results.

Conclusion
==========
