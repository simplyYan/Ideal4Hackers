.. title:: A Comprehensive Guide to Weevely

Introduction
============

Weevely is a stealthy and versatile webshell tool used for maintaining unauthorized access to web servers and executing various post-exploitation tasks. It provides an extensive set of features for remote administration, data exfiltration, and lateral movement on compromised web servers. In this guide, we will explore Weevely in detail, covering its features, installation, basic usage, and examples.

Installation
============

To use Weevely, you need to install it on your system. Here are the general steps for installing Weevely:

1. **Download Weevely**:

   Visit the official Weevely GitHub repository (https://github.com/epinna/weevely3) to download the latest version of Weevely.

2. **Install Weevely**:

   Extract the downloaded archive and use the `weevely` script to set up the webshell. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python weevely.py generate <password> <output-file>

   Replace `<password>` with your desired password and `<output-file>` with the name of the generated webshell file.

Basic Usage
===========

Weevely provides a wide range of functionalities for webshell-based post-exploitation activities. Here are some essential components and basic usage:

1. **Accessing the Webshell**:

   Upload the generated webshell file to the target web server. You can access the webshell by navigating to it in a web browser.

2. **Authentication**:

   Use the configured password to log in to the webshell when prompted.

3. **Remote Commands**:

   Weevely allows you to execute remote commands on the target server. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      weevely <target-url> <password> system_info

   Replace `<target-url>` with the URL of the webshell and `<password>` with the configured password.

4. **File Management**:

   You can navigate and manipulate files and directories on the target server using Weevely's built-in file management commands.

Examples
========

Example 1: Uploading and Accessing the Webshell
----------------------------------------------

1. Generate a Weevely webshell with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python weevely.py generate mypassword /path/to/output/webshell.php

   This generates a webshell with the password "mypassword" and saves it to the specified path.

2. Upload the webshell file to the target web server using methods like FTP or a vulnerable file upload feature.

3. Access the webshell in a web browser by navigating to its URL (e.g., `https://target.com/webshell.php`).

4. Log in with the configured password ("mypassword") when prompted.

Example 2: Executing Remote Commands
--------------------------------------

1. Access the Weevely webshell on the target server.

2. Execute remote commands, such as retrieving system information:

   .. code-block:: bash

      weevely https://target.com/webshell.php mypassword system_info

   Replace `https://target.com/webshell.php` with the actual webshell URL and `mypassword` with the configured password.

Conclusion
==========

Weevely is a powerful tool for maintaining unauthorized access to web servers and conducting post-exploitation activities.
