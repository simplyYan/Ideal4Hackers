   ```

3. **Customize Configuration (Optional)**:

   Optionally, you can customize the configuration files to tailor the payloads and attack vectors to your testing needs.

Basic Usage
===========

Laudanum provides a wide range of payloads and attack vectors that can be used for testing web applications. Here's a simplified example of how to use Laudanum:

1. **Select a Payload**:

   Navigate to the appropriate directory for the type of payload you want to use. For example, for SQL injection payloads, you would go to the "sqlinjection" directory:

   ```bash
   cd sqlinjection
   ```

2. **Choose a Payload**:

   Select a specific payload file. For instance, to use a MySQL-based SQL injection payload, you can choose a payload file like "mysql.js":

   ```bash
   nano mysql.js
   ```

3. **Customize and Use**:

   Customize the payload according to your target application and attack scenario. Save the changes and then use the payload within your testing framework or HTTP request.

Examples
========

Example 1: Using a SQL Injection Payload
------------------------------------------

1. Navigate to the SQL injection payloads directory:

   ```bash
   cd laudanum/sqlinjection
   ```

2. Choose a SQL injection payload, e.g., "mysql.js":

   ```bash
   nano mysql.js
   ```

3. Customize the payload for your target SQL injection scenario.

4. Use the customized payload within your testing framework or manually craft an HTTP request to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.

Conclusion
==========

Laudanum is a valuable collection of tools and payloads for testing web application vulnerabilities. It serves as an educational resource and a practical toolkit for security professionals, penetration testers, and developers.
