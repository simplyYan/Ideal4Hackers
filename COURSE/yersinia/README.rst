.. title:: A Comprehensive Guide to Yersinia

Introduction
============

Yersinia is an open-source network penetration testing tool that specializes in performing Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) attacks. It allows security professionals and network administrators to test the security of their network infrastructure by simulating various network attacks. Yersinia supports several network protocols and attacks, making it a valuable tool for assessing network vulnerabilities. In this guide, we will explore Yersinia in detail, covering its features, installation, basic usage, and examples.

Installation
============

To use Yersinia, you need to install it on your system. Here are the general steps for installation:

1. **Download Yersinia**:

   - Visit the official Yersinia GitHub repository (https://github.com/tomac/yersinia) to clone or download the repository.

2. **Compile and Install Yersinia**:

   - Navigate to the Yersinia source code directory and follow the installation instructions provided in the README or documentation.

Basic Usage
===========

Yersinia provides a command-line interface for launching various Layer 2 attacks. Here are some essential components and basic usage:

1. **General Syntax**:

   Yersinia's basic syntax is as follows:

   ```plaintext
   yersinia [options] attack
   ```

   - `attack`: Specify the specific attack to launch.
   - `options`: Customize the attack with various options and parameters.

2. **Example Usage**:

   To launch an attack using Yersinia, you would use a command like the following:

   ```bash
   sudo yersinia -G -I <interface> -attack
   ```

   Replace `<interface>` with the name of the network interface you want to use for the attack, and replace `-attack` with the specific attack you want to perform (e.g., `-arp` for ARP spoofing).

Examples
========

Example 1: ARP Spoofing Attack
-------------------------------

1. Launch an ARP spoofing attack on a target network using Yersinia. Assume you have an interface named "eth0" and you want to target the IP address "192.168.1.100":

   ```bash
   sudo yersinia -G -I eth0 -M -T 192.168.1.100 -attack arp
   ```

   This command tells Yersinia to perform an ARP spoofing attack on the specified network interface and target IP address.

2. Observe the results of the ARP spoofing attack, including network traffic redirection.

Example 2: VLAN Hopping Attack
-------------------------------

1. Launch a VLAN hopping attack using Yersinia. Assume you have an interface named "eth0" and you want to target VLAN 10:

   ```bash
   sudo yersinia -G -I eth0 -V 10 -attack vlan
   ```

   This command instructs Yersinia to perform a VLAN hopping attack on the specified network interface and VLAN ID.

2. Observe the results of the VLAN hopping attack and any successful VLAN traversal.

Conclusion
==========

Yersinia is a versatile tool for network penetration testing and security assessments, specializing in Layer 2 attacks. It provides various attack modules and options for testing the security of network infrastructure. When using Yersinia for security testing, ensure that you have proper authorization to assess the target network, as unauthorized attacks may have legal and ethical implications.

This guide has provided an overview of Yersinia, including installation, basic usage, and practical examples. Continue to explore its capabilities to assess network vulnerabilities effectively.
