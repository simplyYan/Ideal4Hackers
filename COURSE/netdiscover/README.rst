.. title:: A Comprehensive Guide to Netdiscover

Introduction
============

Netdiscover is a network scanning tool used for discovering hosts on a local network. It's a valuable utility for network administrators, security professionals, and anyone interested in understanding the devices connected to a network. In this guide, we'll explore netdiscover in detail, covering its features, usage, and examples.

Installation
============

To use netdiscover, you need to install it on your system. The installation process may vary depending on your operating system. For example, on Debian-based systems, you can install it using `apt`:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install netdiscover

Basic Usage
===========

Netdiscover is straightforward to use with the following basic syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

    netdiscover [options]

Commonly used options include:

- `-i` or `--interface`: Specify the network interface to use.
- `-r` or `--range`: Define the IP address range to scan.
- `-p` or `--passive`: Enable passive mode (no ARP requests).
- `-S` or `--sendtime`: Set the packet send delay.

Advanced Usage
==============

Netdiscover offers advanced options for fine-tuning your scans, including:

- Customizing ARP packet size.
- Filtering results using regular expressions.
- Saving scan results to a file.
- Specifying a custom MAC address.

Examples
========

Example 1: Basic Scan
----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    netdiscover -i eth0

This command scans the network using the "eth0" interface.

Example 2: Passive Scan
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    netdiscover -i eth0 -p

In passive mode, netdiscover listens for ARP packets on the network without sending any requests.

Example 3: Custom Range
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24

This command scans the specified IP range on the "eth0" interface.

Example 4: Saving Results
--------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    netdiscover -i eth0 -r 192.168.1.0/24 -o results.txt

The results are saved to a file named "results.txt."

Conclusion
==========

Netdiscover is a powerful tool for network discovery and reconnaissance. It can help you identify active hosts on a local network and gather essential information about them. By mastering its features and options, you can enhance your network administration and security skills.
